    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started my careed as an Embedded software developer focusing in real-time 
      application on ARM-based micro processor. Embedded softwares that i developed mostly 
      got engaged with high level softwares to either provide monitoing or controlling
      on the embedded device and as a result, developing those softwares were became part of my job too.
      These days i work mostly as data engineer on distributed AI-based software where i develope software 
      for every component of the system. Backend development, Data aggregation, preprocessing and Firmware for embedded devices
      are part of my daily job.
